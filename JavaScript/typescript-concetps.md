# Difference between `any` and `unknown`

In TypeScript, the difference between `any` and `unknown` is all about **type safety** and how much trust the compiler gives you.

---

### üß® `any`: "I don't care what it is"
- You can assign **anything** to a variable of type `any`.
- You can then do **anything** with it‚Äîcall methods, access properties, etc.
- TypeScript won‚Äôt check if what you‚Äôre doing makes sense.
- It‚Äôs like telling the compiler: ‚ÄúTrust me, I got this.‚Äù

```ts
let value: any = "hello";
value.toUpperCase(); // OK
value();             // Also OK (even if it's not a function!)
```

---

### üõ°Ô∏è `unknown`: "I don‚Äôt know what it is (yet)"
- You can assign **anything** to `unknown`, just like `any`.
- But you **can‚Äôt use** it until you **narrow** it to a specific type.
- It forces you to be explicit and safe.

```ts
let value: unknown = "hello";
value.toUpperCase(); // ‚ùå Error: Object is of type 'unknown'

if (typeof value === "string") {
  console.log(value.toUpperCase()); // ‚úÖ Safe now
}
```

---

### üß† Mental model:
- `any` = ‚Äú_I don‚Äôt care_ what this is.‚Äù
- `unknown` = ‚Äú_I don‚Äôt know_ what this is, so I‚Äôll check first.‚Äù

---

In short: **`unknown` is the type-safe version of `any`**. If you're writing robust, maintainable code, `unknown` is usually the better choice.

# Diff between `interface` and `type`

In TypeScript, both `interface` and `type` let you describe the shape of data‚Äîbut they have some subtle and not-so-subtle differences. Here's a quick breakdown:

---

### üß± 1. **Use Case & Flexibility**
- **`interface`**: Best for defining the shape of **objects and classes**.
- **`type`**: More flexible‚Äîyou can define **primitives, unions, intersections, tuples**, and more.

```ts
type ID = string | number; // ‚úÖ valid
interface ID = string | number; // ‚ùå invalid
```

---

### üîÅ 2. **Extending & Composition**
- Both can be extended, but the syntax differs:
  - `interface` uses `extends`
  - `type` uses intersections (`&`)

```ts
interface A { x: number }
interface B extends A { y: number }

type C = { x: number }
type D = C & { y: number }
```

---

### üß¨ 3. **Declaration Merging**
- **Only `interface`** supports declaration merging‚Äîmultiple declarations with the same name are merged.

```ts
interface User { name: string }
interface User { age: number }
// Result: User has both name and age
```

- `type` will throw an error if you try to redefine it.

---

### üß™ 4. **Function & Tuple Types**
- `type` is preferred for **function signatures** and **tuples**.

```ts
type Greet = (name: string) => void;
type Point = [number, number];
```

---

### üß† TL;DR
| Feature                  | `interface`         | `type`                     |
|--------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|
| Object shape             | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚úÖ Yes                      |
| Primitives, unions, etc. | ‚ùå No               | ‚úÖ Yes                      |
| Declaration merging      | ‚úÖ Yes              | ‚ùå No                       |
| Extending                | ‚úÖ `extends`        | ‚úÖ `&` (intersection)       |
| Function types           | üòê Verbose          | ‚úÖ Cleaner syntax           |
| Preferred for classes    | ‚úÖ Yes              | üòê Possible but uncommon    |

---

If you're defining an object or class structure, `interface` is often the go-to. But for everything else‚Äîespecially when you need flexibility‚Äî`type` is your friend.

# How JS Understand union type


In short: **TypeScript understands unions, JavaScript doesn‚Äôt ‚Äî it just runs the final, type-erased code**.

```ts
function printId(id: string | number) {
  console.log(id);
}
```

You're telling **TypeScript** that `id` can be either a `string` or a `number`. But once you compile this code to JavaScript, the type information is **stripped away** ‚Äî JavaScript just sees:

```js
function printId(id) {
  console.log(id);
}
```

So how does it work?

### üß† TypeScript handles unions at compile time:
- It checks your code and ensures you **narrow** the type before using it.
- For example, you might use `typeof` to check the type:

```ts
if (typeof id === "string") {
  console.log(id.toUpperCase()); // Safe
} else {
  console.log(id.toFixed(2));    // Also safe
}
```


-------

# Abstract Classes 

```ts
// Abstract base class
abstract class Animal {
  constructor(public name: string) {}

  // Abstract method ‚Äî must be implemented by subclasses
  abstract makeSound(): void;

  // Normal method ‚Äî can be inherited
  move(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} moves gracefully.`);
  }
}

// Subclass 1
class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: Woof!`);
  }
}

// Subclass 2
class Cat extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} says: Meow!`);
  }
}

// Usage
const myDog = new Dog("Buddy");
myDog.makeSound(); // Buddy says: Woof!
myDog.move();      // Buddy moves gracefully.

const myCat = new Cat("Luna");
myCat.makeSound(); // Luna says: Meow!
myCat.move();      // Luna moves gracefully.
```

### üß† Key Takeaways:
- You **can't instantiate** an abstract class directly.
- Subclasses **must implement** all abstract methods.
- Abstract classes can have both abstract and normal methods.

Nope ‚Äî in TypeScript, you **cannot create an object directly from an abstract class**. That‚Äôs the whole point of marking a class as `abstract`: it‚Äôs meant to serve as a blueprint, not a finished product.

If you try something like this:

```ts
abstract class Animal {
  abstract makeSound(): void;
}

const pet = new Animal(); // ‚ùå Error: Cannot create an instance of an abstract class.
```
----------
# Type assertions

Type assertions in TypeScript are like telling the compiler, ‚ÄúHey, I know more about this value‚Äôs type than you do ‚Äî trust me.‚Äù

A **type assertion** lets you manually specify the type of a value when TypeScript can‚Äôt infer it correctly. It doesn‚Äôt change the value at runtime ‚Äî it just tells the compiler how to treat it during type checking.

You can write it in two ways:
```ts
const value = someVar as string;      // Preferred
const value = <string>someVar;        // Also valid (except in JSX)
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è When Should You Use It?

1. **Working with `any` or `unknown`**
   ```ts
   const data: any = "hello";
   const length = (data as string).length;
   ```

2. **Accessing DOM elements**
   ```ts
   const input = document.querySelector('input') as HTMLInputElement;
   console.log(input.value);
   ```

3. **Narrowing union types**
   ```ts
   function handle(id: string | number) {
     if (typeof id === "string") {
       const upper = (id as string).toUpperCase();
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Using third-party libraries or dynamic data**
   When TypeScript doesn‚Äôt know the shape of the data (like from an API), you can assert it:
   ```ts
   const user = response as { name: string; age: number };
   ```

---

# Literal Types

In TypeScript, **literal types** let you specify the *exact* value a variable can hold ‚Äî not just the general type like `string` or `number`, but a specific one like `"success"` or `42`.

---

### üî§ Types of Literal Types

1. **String Literal Types**
   ```ts
   type Direction = "up" | "down" | "left" | "right";
   let move: Direction;
   move = "up";     // ‚úÖ OK
   move = "forward"; // ‚ùå Error

    let x: "hello" = "hello";
    // OK
    x = "hello";
    // ...
    x = "howdy";
    Type '"howdy"' is not assignable to type '"hello"'.
    //Here variable x is also behaving like const because we cannot assign anyother value instead of hello.

   ```

2. **Numeric Literal Types**
   ```ts
   type DiceRoll = 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6;
   let roll: DiceRoll = 4; // ‚úÖ OK
   ```

3. **Const Literal Types**
   ```ts
   const constantString = "Hello World";
      - const constantString: "Hello World"
    //Because constantString can only represent 1 possible string, it has a literal type representation If you hover on constantString variable you will see.
   ```

---

### üß† Why Use Literal Types?

- **Restrict values** to a known set (like enums)
- **Improve type safety** and catch errors at compile time
- **Guide control flow** with discriminated unions

---

### üß™ Real-World Example

```ts
type Status = "loading" | "success" | "error";

function showStatus(status: Status) {
  if (status === "success") {
    console.log("All good!");
  }
}
```

Only `"loading"`, `"success"`, or `"error"` are allowed ‚Äî anything else will throw a compile-time error.

---------

# typeof null

```ts
    function print(strs: string | string[] | null) {
        if(typeof strs === 'object') {
            for(const s of strs) {
                //We are checking type to loop over string[] But this will give error -> 'strs' is possibly 'null'.
                // typeof null is also object. thats why it giving error.
            }
        } else if (typeof str === 'string'){
            //
        } else {
            //
        }
    }
```

**typeof null is actually "object"! This is one of those unfortunate accidents of history.**

------

# üß± What Are Static Members?

In TypeScript, **static members** are properties or methods that belong to the **class itself**, not to instances of the class.


```ts
class MathUtils {
  static PI = 3.14;

  static square(x: number): number {
    return x * x;
  }
}

console.log(MathUtils.PI);         // ‚úÖ Access without creating an object
console.log(MathUtils.square(5));  // ‚úÖ 25
```

- You **don‚Äôt need to instantiate** the class to use static members.
- They‚Äôre accessed via `ClassName.member`, not `this.member`.
---

### ‚úÖ When Static Members *Are* Useful

- Utility/helper functions (e.g. `Math.abs()`)
- Shared constants (`AppConfig.DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)
- Factory methods (`User.createFromJson()`)

---

# `Partial<Type>` and `Required<Type>`

In TypeScript, `Partial<Type>` and `Required<Type>` are **utility types** that help you transform existing types by adjusting the *optionality* of their properties.

---

### üß© `Partial<Type>`

This makes **all properties optional**.

```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}

const updateUser = (user: Partial<User>) => {
  // user.name and user.age are optional here because of Partial utility type.
  // Without Partial type, you must need to provide name and age both.
};
```

‚úÖ Use it when:
- You‚Äôre updating part of an object (e.g. patch APIs)
- You want to allow incomplete data

---

### üîí `Required<Type>`

This makes **all properties required**, even if they were optional in the original type.

```ts
interface User {
  name?: string;
  age?: number;
}

const createUser = (user: Required<User>) => {
  // user.name and user.age must be provided because of Required Type while in origional interface they are optional.
};
```

‚úÖ Use it when:
- You want to enforce that all fields are present
- You're validating or finalizing an object

---

# Generics

In TypeScript, **generics** are a way to create reusable components that work with **any data type**, while still maintaining **type safety**.

---

### üß† Why Use Generics?

Without generics, you'd either:
- Use `any` (which loses type safety), or
- Write multiple versions of the same function for different types

Generics let you write **one version** that works for all types ‚Äî and TypeScript will still check types for you.

---

### üß™ Basic Example: Identity Function

```ts
function identity<T>(value: T): T {
  return value;
}

const num = identity<number>(42);       // T is number
const str = identity<string>("hello");  // T is string
```

- `T` is a **type variable** ‚Äî a placeholder for the actual type
- TypeScript infers the type when you call the function

---

### üì¶ Generic Function with Arrays

```ts
function firstElement<T>(arr: T[]): T {
  return arr[0];
}

const first = firstElement<string>(["a", "b", "c"]); // "a"
```

---

### üß± Generic Interface

```ts
interface Box<T> {
  value: T;
}

const stringBox: Box<string> = { value: "hello" };
const numberBox: Box<number> = { value: 123 };
```

---

### üèóÔ∏è Generic Class

```ts
class Container<T> {
  private content: T;

  constructor(value: T) {
    this.content = value;
  }

  getContent(): T {
    return this.content;
  }
}

const c = new Container<boolean>(true);
```

---

### üîí With Constraints

You can restrict what types are allowed:

```ts
function logLength<T extends { length: number }>(item: T): void {
  console.log(item.length);
}

logLength("hello");       // ‚úÖ
logLength([1, 2, 3]);      // ‚úÖ
logLength(123);            // ‚ùå Error: number has no length
```

---

Generics are everywhere in TypeScript ‚Äî from `Array<T>` to `Promise<T>` to `Map<K, V>`.

-------------

# üß† What is Type Inference?

**Type inference** means **TypeScript figures out the type for you**, even if you didn‚Äôt explicitly annotate it.

You write less code üßë‚Äçüíª, and TypeScript still gives you full type safety ‚úÖ.

---

### üîç Basic Example
```ts
let message = "Hello, world!";
```
- TypeScript infers that `message` is of type `string` ‚Äî because `"Hello, world!"` is a string literal.

```ts
let count = 10; // inferred as number
```

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Function Inference
```ts
function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}
// TypeScript infers the return type as number
```

Even without explicitly writing `: number`, TypeScript knows what‚Äôs coming back.

---

### ü™Ñ Array Inference
```ts
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
// inferred as string[]
```

---

### üß© Contextual Typing
When you pass a function as an argument:
```ts
const names = ["Alice", "Bob"];
names.forEach(name => {
  // name is inferred as string
  console.log(name.toUpperCase());
});
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è When to Be Explicit
TypeScript‚Äôs inference is smart, but for:
- **APIs**
- **Public libraries**
- **Complex logic**

‚Ä¶it's better to write explicit types for clarity, maintainability, and readability.

---

### ‚úÖ `let num = 5;`  `let num: number = 5;`

### üß† So, which is more accurate?

If the question is about **TypeScript best practices or accuracy**, then:

> ‚úÖ **`let num = 5;` is more accurate** ‚Äî because TypeScript infers the type as `number` anyway, and there's no need to repeat yourself.
