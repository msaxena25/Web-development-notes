JavaScript's **garbage collector** (GC) is an automatic memory management feature that identifies and removes objects no longer in use, freeing up memory for other operations. The key goal is to prevent **memory leaks** by ensuring that unreachable objects are cleaned up.

---

### **Key Concepts**

#### 1. **Memory Allocation**
   - When you declare variables, create objects, or allocate resources, memory is allocated to store those values.
   ```javascript
   let obj = { name: "Alice" }; // Memory allocated for `obj`
   ```

#### 2. **Reachability**
   - An object is considered "reachable" if it can be accessed or used in the program.
   - Examples of reachable objects:
     - Variables in the current function scope.
     - Variables in the global scope.
     - Objects referenced by reachable objects.
   - When an object is no longer reachable, it is eligible for garbage collection.

---

### **How Garbage Collection Works**

#### **1. Mark-and-Sweep Algorithm**
This is the most commonly used garbage collection algorithm in JavaScript.

1. **Mark Phase:**
   - The garbage collector starts with a "root" set of references (e.g., global variables or the call stack).
   - It "marks" all objects reachable from the root as "alive."
   
2. **Sweep Phase:**
   - Any object not marked as "alive" is considered unreachable and is removed from memory.
   
   Example:
   ```javascript
   let obj1 = { data: "Hello" };
   let obj2 = { data: "World" };

   obj1.ref = obj2; // obj1 references obj2
   obj2 = null; // obj2 is no longer referenced directly

   // obj2 is still reachable through obj1.ref, so it won't be collected.
   ```

#### **2. Reference Counting**
   - Some engines (though less commonly) use **reference counting**, which keeps track of how many references exist to each object.
   - When the reference count drops to 0, the object is eligible for garbage collection.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let obj = { data: "Hello" };
   obj = null; // Reference count becomes 0, so it can be garbage collected.
   ```

---

### **Advanced Concepts**

#### **1. Cyclic References**
   - In the **reference counting** approach, objects with cyclic references might not be collected.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     function createCycle() {
       let obj1 = {};
       let obj2 = {};
       obj1.ref = obj2; // obj1 references obj2
       obj2.ref = obj1; // obj2 references obj1
     }
     createCycle(); // These objects are unreachable but cannot be collected with reference counting.
     ```
   - Modern engines (e.g., V8) handle this through **mark-and-sweep**, which detects and collects cyclic references.

#### **2. Generational Garbage Collection**
   - Modern JavaScript engines use a **generational garbage collection** approach to optimize performance:
     - **Young Generation (Nursery):** Newly created objects are stored here. These are collected more frequently.
     - **Old Generation:** Objects that survive multiple garbage collection cycles are moved here. These are collected less frequently.

#### **3. Incremental Garbage Collection**
   - Instead of blocking the entire program to perform garbage collection, the garbage collector works in small chunks, pausing and resuming as needed.

### **Performance Considerations**

1. **Avoid Memory Leaks**
   - Common causes of memory leaks:
     - **Global variables** that are not cleaned up.
     - **Detached DOM nodes** (elements removed from the DOM but still referenced in JavaScript).
     - **Uncleared timers or intervals** (`setInterval`, `setTimeout`).
     - **Event listeners** not removed after use.

2. **Use `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`**
   - These data structures hold weak references and do not prevent garbage collection.
   ```javascript
   let cache = new WeakMap();
   let obj = {};
   cache.set(obj, "value");

   obj = null; // The object can still be garbage collected.
   ```

3. **Minimize Unnecessary Allocations**
   - Reuse objects and avoid creating large numbers of temporary objects in performance-critical code.

### **Tools to Monitor Garbage Collection**
- **Browser Developer Tools:**
  - In Chrome or Edge DevTools:
    - Use the **Memory tab** to analyze heap snapshots and identify memory leaks.
    - Track garbage collection events and memory usage trends.

- **Performance Profiling:**
  - Tools like Lighthouse or browser-specific profilers can help pinpoint memory-related performance bottlenecks.

By understanding how JavaScript's garbage collector works, you can write memory-efficient code and avoid common pitfalls like memory leaks or performance degradation.


## **Who is responsible for garbage collector**

The **JavaScript engine** is responsible for performing garbage collection. Each JavaScript runtime environment (like web browsers or server-side platforms like Node.js) has its own engine that includes a garbage collector to manage memory. Here are the major engines:

---

### **JavaScript Engines**

1. **V8 (Google)**
   - Used by Google Chrome and Node.js.
   - Known for its high performance and advanced garbage collection techniques like **Generational Garbage Collection** and **Incremental Mark-and-Sweep**.

2. **SpiderMonkey (Mozilla)**
   - Used by Mozilla Firefox.
   - Implements similar garbage collection techniques as V8, optimized for Firefox.

3. **JavaScriptCore (Apple)**
   - Also called Nitro.
   - Used by Safari and WebKit-based browsers.

4. **Chakra (Microsoft)**
   - Used in older versions of Microsoft Edge (before it switched to Chromium).
   - Implements its garbage collection methods for efficient memory management.

---

### **How It Works**
- The engine performs garbage collection **automatically**; developers don't need to manually allocate or free memory (unlike languages like C or C++).
- The garbage collector is integrated into the engine's runtime and works in the background, identifying and cleaning up unused or unreachable objects.

---

### **Execution Timing**
- **When does garbage collection occur?**
  - It's non-deterministic, meaning you can't predict exactly when the garbage collector will run.
  - The engine decides based on various factors, such as memory usage, system resources, and thresholds set internally by the garbage collection algorithm.

## **Memory leak**


A **memory leak** in JavaScript occurs when memory that is no longer needed or used by the application isn't released by the garbage collector, leading to wasted memory. Over time, this can degrade performance and potentially crash the application.

---

### **Common Causes of Memory Leaks in JavaScript**

1. **Global Variables**
   - Variables declared without `let`, `const`, or `var` are implicitly added to the global scope, making them persist throughout the application's lifecycle.
   ```javascript
   function leak() {
     leakedVariable = 'I am a leak'; // Implicit global variable
   }
   ```

2. **Forgotten Timers or Callbacks**
   - `setInterval` or `setTimeout` that are not cleared can retain references to objects.
   ```javascript
   const intervalId = setInterval(() => console.log('Leaking'), 1000);
   // Forgetting to clear it can cause a memory leak.
   ```

3. **Detached DOM Elements**
   - Removing a DOM element but retaining a reference to it in JavaScript prevents it from being garbage collected.
   ```javascript
   let div = document.createElement('div');
   document.body.appendChild(div);
   document.body.removeChild(div);
   // If `div` is still referenced, it's not garbage collected.
   ```

4. **Event Listeners**
   - Adding event listeners to DOM elements without removing them when the elements are no longer in use.
   ```javascript
   const btn = document.getElementById('myButton');
   btn.addEventListener('click', () => console.log('Clicked!'));
   // If the button is removed from the DOM but the listener is not cleaned, memory is leaked.
   ```

5. **Closures Holding References**
   - Closures can inadvertently capture and hold references to objects that are no longer needed.
   ```javascript
   function createClosure() {
     const largeArray = new Array(1000000);
     return function () {
       console.log(largeArray.length);
     };
   }
   const closure = createClosure();
   ```

6. **Circular References**
   - Two objects reference each other, creating a cycle that prevents garbage collection.
   ```javascript
   const obj1 = {};
   const obj2 = {};
   obj1.ref = obj2;
   obj2.ref = obj1;
   ```

---

### **How to Prevent Memory Leaks**

#### **1. Use `let` or `const` for Variable Declarations**
   - Always declare variables with `let` or `const` to avoid implicit global variables.
   ```javascript
   let myVariable = 'No leak!';
   ```

#### **2. Properly Clear Timers and Intervals**
   - Always clear `setInterval` or `setTimeout` when they are no longer needed.
   ```javascript
   const intervalId = setInterval(() => console.log('Running'), 1000);
   clearInterval(intervalId); // Clear it when done.
   ```

#### **3. Remove Event Listeners**
   - Use `removeEventListener` to clean up event handlers when an element is no longer in use.
   ```javascript
   const btn = document.getElementById('myButton');
   const clickHandler = () => console.log('Clicked!');
   btn.addEventListener('click', clickHandler);
   btn.removeEventListener('click', clickHandler); // Clean up!
   ```

#### **4. Avoid Retaining References**
   - Set unused variables and objects to `null` to explicitly indicate they are no longer needed.
   ```javascript
   let obj = { data: 'Important' };
   obj = null; // Ready for garbage collection.
   ```

#### **5. Break Circular References**
   - Break references manually or use `WeakMap` or `WeakSet`, which hold weak references.
   ```javascript
   let obj1 = {};
   let obj2 = {};
   obj1.ref = obj2;
   obj2.ref = null; // Break the reference to allow GC.
   ```

#### **6. Use WeakMap or WeakSet**
   - Use these data structures for objects that can be garbage collected when no longer referenced elsewhere.
   ```javascript
   let cache = new WeakMap();
   let key = {};
   cache.set(key, 'value');
   key = null; // Object can now be garbage collected.
   ```

#### **7. Monitor and Profile Memory Usage**
   - Use browser DevTools to identify memory leaks:
     - **Chrome:** Open DevTools → Memory Tab → Take Heap Snapshots.
     - Look for growing retained object sizes or increasing detached nodes.

#### **8. Be Cautious with Closures**
   - Avoid capturing unnecessary references in closures.
   ```javascript
   function safeClosure() {
     const data = 'Important';
     return () => console.log(data);
   }
   ```

#### **9. Use FinalizationRegistry for Cleanup**
   - Automatically clean up resources when objects are garbage collected.
   ```javascript
   const registry = new FinalizationRegistry((value) => {
     console.log(`${value} was garbage collected.`);
   });
   let obj = {};
   registry.register(obj, 'MyObject');
   obj = null;
   ```
