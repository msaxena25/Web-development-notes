### How do you manage when there are high priority tasks need to deliver in release in very limited time period?

1. Discuss with Client on tasks and priorities them first. High priority, Medium priority & low priority.
2. List down all tasks which have to go in this release, and list down tasks which we can give in next time.
3. Understand complete requirements & documents or stories of those tasks.
4. Effort evaluation
5. Check for Resources availability.
6. Divide tasks
	a. If there is any similar tasks or screen which we did previously in project, we give to Junior resource.
	b. If any new or challenging tasks, give it to senior resource.
7. Try to finish in timeline.
8. Sometimes we also give extra time in a day or complete work in Weekends if things are critical.
9. We mark story as done when unit test cases are also covered but In case time does not allowed us then we skip this for this release and pick those in next 
	sprints. And if sonar pipelines does not succeed just because of low coverage then we asks client and devops teams to merge PRs manually.


### How do you handle changes which comes in middle of sprints?

1. We are working in agile mode so changes are always welcome. But mostly we try to freeze things and requirements before start sprint and also give efforts based on that. Incase there are changes comes then we mark those as Change request and pick in next sprint.
 2. If there are minor changes , then we catch those and consider in current working sprint.
 3. Incase we are working on a feature that discussed previously and middle of sprint, a big changes has been introduced in that tasks, then we again discuss new changes and requirements with client and consider those changes but now our efforts change. And at last if items does not finish of current sprint then we move them to backlog.
