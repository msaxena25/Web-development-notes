# Domain

In the context of a software development interview, a **domain** refers to the specific area or industry for which you have developed software or worked on projects. It represents the business context or functional field where your technical skills were applied. 

For example:
- **Banking/Finance**: Developing applications for online banking, stock trading, or payment gateways.
- **Healthcare**: Creating software for patient management, telemedicine, or wearable health devices.
- **E-commerce**: Building platforms for online shopping, inventory management, or personalized recommendations.
- **Education**: Working on e-learning systems, virtual classrooms, or training tools.

When the interviewer asks, "How many domains have you worked on?" they want to understand:
1. **Your versatility**: Can you adapt to different industries or business needs?
2. **Domain knowledge**: Do you have experience with specific industries or workflows?
3. **Problem-solving in context**: How well do you understand and address challenges unique to each domain?
