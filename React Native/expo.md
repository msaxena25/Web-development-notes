# 🚀 What is Expo?

> **Expo** is an **open-source platform** built on top of **React Native** that simplifies the development, building, and deployment of mobile apps.

Think of it as a **toolkit + service layer** that helps you get started and go faster with React Native — especially if you don’t want to dive deep into native code initially.

---

## 🔗 How is Expo Connected to React Native?

* **Expo is built on React Native** — it uses React Native internally.
* It wraps the React Native APIs and provides:

  * Pre-built libraries (camera, maps, sensors, notifications, etc.)
  * Tools (CLI, Expo Go app)
  * Hosting & build services (via [Expo.dev](https://expo.dev))

## 🧠 Key Differences Between Expo and Plain React Native

| Feature               | Expo (Managed)                         | React Native (Bare)               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Native Code Access    | ❌ Not allowed (in managed workflow)    | ✅ Full access                     |
| Setup Time            | ⚡ Super fast (1 command to start)      | 🛠️ Requires Xcode/Android Studio |
| Pre-built APIs        | ✅ Comes with many (camera, maps, etc.) | ❌ Must add manually               |
| OTA Updates           | ✅ Built-in via Expo                    | ❌ Manual or via third-party       |
| Custom Native Modules | ❌ Limited (unless using Bare Workflow) | ✅ Fully customizable              |

## 🛠️ Two Workflows in Expo

1. **Managed Workflow**

   * Write only JS/TS (no native code)
   * Fastest setup, best for prototyping & small apps

2. **Bare Workflow**

   * Full access to iOS/Android native code
   * Works like plain React Native + Expo SDK

---

Full list of **important Expo commands** to **create**, **start**, **build**, and **manage** your React Native app using **Expo CLI** and **EAS CLI (Expo Application Services)**.

---

## 🔧 **1. Install Expo CLI (One-time)**

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

---

## 🚀 **2. Create a New Expo App**

```bash
npx create-expo-app my-app
cd my-app
```

### Optional: With template (e.g., with TypeScript)

```bash
npx create-expo-app my-app --template
```

---

## ▶️ **3. Start the App in Dev Mode**

```bash
npx expo start
```

* Opens Metro Bundler in your browser.
* Scan QR code with **Expo Go app** to preview.

---

## 🛠️ **4. Run on Specific Platforms (Simulators or Devices)**

| Platform | Command                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| Android  | `npx expo run:android`          |
| iOS      | `npx expo run:ios` *(mac only)* |
| Web      | `npx expo start --web`          |

---

## 📦 **5. Install Expo SDK Packages**

```bash
npx expo install expo-camera expo-location
```

> ⚠️ Use `expo install` instead of `npm install` so it picks the correct compatible versions.

---

## 🧪 **6. Test App on Real Device**

* Install **Expo Go** from the Play Store / App Store.
* Scan the QR code from Metro Bundler (`expo start`).

---

## 📲 **7. Build APK / AAB / IPA using EAS**

### First, install EAS CLI:

```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Login to your Expo account:

```bash
eas login
```

---

### Configure EAS (One-time):

```bash
eas build:configure
```

---

### Android Build (APK or AAB):

```bash
eas build --platform android
```

### iOS Build (requires Apple Developer account & macOS):

```bash
eas build --platform ios
```

> Output will be hosted on Expo servers and you'll get a shareable link.

---

## 🌐 **8. Publish OTA (Over-the-Air) Update**

```bash
npx expo publish
```

> Sends JS-only updates instantly to users without app store submission.

---

## 🛑 **9. Stop Development Server**

```bash
CTRL + C
```

---

## 🧹 **10. Clear Cache**

```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

---

## 🗑️ **11. Delete Build Artifacts (optional)**

```bash
rm -rf node_modules .expo .expo-shared
```

Then reinstall:

```bash
npm install
```

---

# ⚙️ What is `npx`?

> **`npx`** is a command-line utility that comes with **Node.js** (since version 5.2.0 of `npm`).  
> It allows you to **run Node.js packages (binaries) directly** without installing them globally.

---

## 🔍 Why Use `npx`?

Because it:
- Runs the **latest version** of a CLI tool temporarily.
- **Avoids global installs**, keeping your system clean.
- Executes CLI commands from your `node_modules/.bin` folder if already installed locally.
- Useful for **one-time or project-specific tools**.

---

## 🧪 Example with Expo:

```bash
npx create-expo-app myApp
```

- This downloads the latest version of `create-expo-app` from npm.
- Runs it **without permanently installing it** on your system.
- Once the command finishes, the binary is discarded (unless cached).

---

## ✅ When to Use `npx` vs `npm install`

| Task                        | Command                        | Notes                              |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Run once-off CLI tools      | `npx create-expo-app`          | Fast, temporary use                 |
| Install tools globally      | `npm install -g expo-cli`      | Available system-wide, version-controlled |
| Install for local project   | `npm install expo`             | Persisted in `node_modules`         |

---

## 💡 Pro Tip:
If you run `npx expo start` in a project that already has `expo` installed locally, `npx` will run the **local version**, ensuring compatibility.

# 📦 What is Expo SDK?

> **Expo SDK** is a collection of **pre-built libraries and APIs** that help you access native device features in a **React Native app** without writing native code.

It allows you to use features like camera, location, notifications, sensors, biometrics, etc., using **pure JavaScript or TypeScript**.

---

## 🧰 Expo SDK Includes:

Here are some of the powerful native modules included:

import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';

const permission = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
const { status } = permission;

if (status === 'granted') {
  // Open camera
}
```

## 📅 Expo SDK Versions

Each version of the Expo SDK is **tightly coupled with a specific React Native version**.

* Latest stable (as of mid-2025): **Expo SDK 50**
* SDK versions follow a consistent release cycle (\~ every quarter)

Check [https://expo.dev](https://expo.dev) for the current version.

# Reading SMS, Sending SMS with Expo SDK

Accessing **SMS functionality** with the **Expo SDK** depends on *what exactly you want to do* — reading SMS, sending SMS, or auto-verifying codes. Here's the breakdown:

---

## 📤 **1. Sending SMS Messages (with user interaction)**

Expo provides a module to **send SMS** using the device's native SMS app (but it requires user confirmation).

### ✅ Use: `expo-sms`

### 🔧 Install:

```bash
npx expo install expo-sms
```

### 💻 Example:

```js
import * as SMS from 'expo-sms';

const sendSMS = async () => {
  const isAvailable = await SMS.isAvailableAsync();

  if (isAvailable) {
    const { result } = await SMS.sendSMSAsync(
      ['1234567890'],      // Phone numbers
      'Hello from Expo!'   // Message
    );
    console.log(result);   // sent / cancelled
  } else {
    alert('SMS is not available on this device');
  }
};
```

---

## ❌ **2. Reading SMS Messages (e.g., OTP Auto-Read)**

> ❌ Expo **does NOT support reading SMS inbox** or auto-reading OTPs in the **Managed Workflow** because that requires sensitive Android permissions and native code (like `RECEIVE_SMS` or `READ_SMS`).

### To do this:

You must **eject to the Bare Workflow** and use a **custom native module** like:

* [`react-native-sms-retriever`](https://github.com/ammarahm-ed/react-native-sms-retriever)
* Native Java/Kotlin implementation on Android

> iOS does **not** allow SMS reading at all — Apple restricts this entirely.

---

## ✅ Alternative: SMS Code Auto-Fill (Android only)

You can use **Google’s SMS Retriever API** via the above libraries, which auto-fills verification codes **without reading SMS content directly**.

This also requires native permissions and setup, so it is **not available in Expo Managed Workflow**.

---

## 🔐 Summary Table

| Feature                    | Supported in Expo Managed | Requires Eject (Bare Workflow) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Send SMS (via user prompt) | ✅ Yes (`expo-sms`)        | ❌ Not needed                   |
| Read SMS (inbox)           | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes                          |
| Auto-verify OTP (Android)  | ❌ No                      | ✅ Yes (with native libs)       |

# React Native Debugger

React Native Debugger works only up to RN 0.78. At RN 0.79+ it's broken, since the remote debugging bridge was removed. Remote JS Debugging, the mechanism that tools like React Native Debugger relied on, was removed in v0.79.
React Native DevTools is now the official, supported debugger (requires Hermes, RN ≥ 0.76).
